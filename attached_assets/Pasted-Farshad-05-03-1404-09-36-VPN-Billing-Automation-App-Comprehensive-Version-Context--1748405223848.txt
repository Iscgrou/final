VPN Billing Automation App (Comprehensive Version)


---

Context & Goal: We aim to develop an Android application for automating billing, accounting, analytics, and representative management within a VPN reseller ecosystem. This app must handle complex data structures from Marzban panel exports, offer deep insights through AI, and provide a Persian interface. It must include encrypted full backup/restore to Google Drive.


---

Design Philosophy (Purpose & Role of Each Module): To ensure correct implementation and prevent misinterpretation by AI agents or developers, each module's operational intent and real-world context must be respected. This section outlines the expected user behavior, manual vs automated logic, and operational dependencies of each key component:

1. Excel Import for Invoicing

NOT a static file dependency: The app must never embed or expect hardcoded Excel files. Instead, a user-triggered “Import File” action should open a file picker, allowing dynamic selection of the latest spreadsheet from internal storage or Google Drive.

Operator-Driven Workflow: Invoices are regenerated each month based on fresh data imports. No file = no billing session. Import is explicit and visible.


2. Invoice Generator

Batch-oriented generation: After importing, the app identifies representatives by their admin_username and processes each one row-by-row.

Dual output options: Generated invoices are exported both as PDF and image (JPG/PNG) to accommodate various delivery platforms (print, messaging).

Persian-first layout: Invoices are RTL, with labels, prices, dates, and contact fields formatted for Persian users.


3. Telegram Integration

Manual messaging strategy: Telegram bots have limitations, so instead, each invoice includes a clickable t.me link for the operator to open and forward manually.

No automatic message delivery: The system is not a bot and doesn't send invoices directly.

Fallback system: Reps without Telegram IDs are shown in a separate “Missing Contact” tab so that the operator can follow up via alternative channels.


4. Representative Management

Human-controlled structure: Reps can be added, edited, or removed manually. Each entry includes financial preferences (per GB price, discounts, etc.)

Referral hierarchy: A “parent rep” field allows mapping multi-level marketing paths (e.g., Behnam introduces Ali). This field affects commission and reporting.

Metadata visibility: Status flags (e.g. inactive, free user, special offer) allow operators to filter and act accordingly.


5. Accounting & Payment History

Manual payment logging: Operator can record partial or full payments per invoice.

Status-calculating engine: Based on payment vs invoice total, the app classifies reps as Debtor, Creditor, or Balanced.

Ledger-style tracking: Each rep has a historical payment log to audit trends.


6. Backup & Cloud Sync

User-initiated backups: Manual backup buttons + scheduled auto-backup once per day.

Encrypted & compressed archives: All backups must be stored as encrypted JSON bundles.

Full recovery flow: After reinstall or migration to new device, the operator must be prompted to restore from Drive (if available).


7. AI-Driven Analytics

Decision-support tool: AI analysis offers suggestions—not commands. Trends are flagged for operator insight.

On-device or cloud AI: Depending on available resources, AI modules may use TensorFlow Lite or Firebase Functions.

Visual first: Output should be represented via dashboards, graphs, and heatmaps, not only text.


8. Operator Experience

Speed over complexity: One-tap shortcuts, large buttons, and intuitive layout to accommodate fast data entry.

Help is built-in: Persian help popups, tooltips, and inline documentation must be accessible.

Smart notifications: Alerts for unpaid invoices, inactive reps, or unlinked Telegrams ensure no data is lost.
